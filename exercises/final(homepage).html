<p> Welcome to my Website! I will be discussing about my passion about soccer, and

<p> In the summer of 2018, my life was exciting because of the World Cup.
  I remember everday I watched all the games relating to the World Cup.
  My team was France all the way because of the great seletion of players in the team.
  Ovearall, France played very well in the begining of the group stages until
  they made it to the final round and won the World Cup 2018 in Russia.<br />
